I am interested in the implementation of an Entity Component System in Golang: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity_component_system

I don't have a specific goal or direction other than implementation and some simple game examples, and I might try to implement some more standard software development technologies to see if this architrecture is feasible to use for more general purposes

I would recommend a different repo/implementation if you actually need one
